Validation
==========
The included test data was generated using Mistal AI's `Le Chat` and does not necessarily represent any real distribution one would expect.
It does however contain the expected number of variables and values for real responses of the EORTC QLQ-C30.


.. to validate:
.. - Run the algorithm on a sample dataset.
.. - Compare the results with locally computed results.
.. - Determine suitable distribution and epsilon values for DP
